// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if
num1 % 2 == 1
print "This is an odd number"

else 
num1 % 2 == 0
print "This is an even number"

if the number is evenly divisible by two with no remainder then it is even
print on the screen whether the number is even or odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

var num1
var num2
var num3
var num4
var num5 
var numsum
var average

num1+num2+num3+num4+num5=numsum 
numsum/5=average

This pseudocode finds the average of 5 different numbers 

for a in range (0,5)

x = int(Enter the number)

if a == 0

smallest = largest = x

if(x < smallest)
	print(This is the smallest number)
smallest = x

if(x > largest)
	print(This is the largest number)
largest = x

This pseudocode prints out the largest number and smallest numbers out of the inputs entered.
